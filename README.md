## What I learned in this project:

- The logic of spliting components.
- Share state between different components by lifting.
- Set proper state for decreasing the state managements. (ex:activePlayer)
- When you shouldn't lift state up. (ex:input field of Player Name)
- Why Immuatablity Matters!
- Reminder : If you use 'console.log()' to see the content of a object , the output may be not true ! (depends on the timing you click )
